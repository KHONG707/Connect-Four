# Connect-Four

## Introduction
Welcome to Connect Four! This simple console-based game allows two players to take turns placing their pieces on a 6x7 game board. The objective is to connect four of your pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before your opponent.

## How to Play
Run the main.py script to start the game.
Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the column (1-7) where they want to drop their piece.
The game ends when one player connects four pieces or when the board is filled, resulting in a draw.
After each game, the players have the option to play again.

## Game Controls
Enter the column number (1-7) when prompted to make a move.
Type "yes" or "no" when asked if you want to play again after a game ends.
